## PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Control as a Service
#### For more information about PID control, see "Introduction to Control System Design - A First Look" by MIT (edX MOOC) 
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-control-system-design-first-mitx-6-302-0x
### Instruction
Download and run PID_client.m (MATLAB file) on your computer where MATLAB is installed (R2014b or higher) or using MATLAB Online (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html). This client will remotely consume the PID control web service (REST API) priovided by the Azure Service Fabric microservices application hosted at csmlab8.uconn.edu. The result is shown below:
